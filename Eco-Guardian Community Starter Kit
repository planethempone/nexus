Below is the structured BOM for the “Eco-Guardian Community Starter Kit” (Standard Node), based on current 2025 market estimates for high-quality, open-source compatible components.

Bill of Materials: Eco-Guardian Community Starter Kit


This kit is designed to be a “Stationary Outdoor Node” that covers air quality, basic weather, and soil health. It is modular, meaning additional water or radiation sensors can be plugged in later via the I2C bus.

Component	Specification / Model	Est. Price (EUR)	Purpose
Microcontroller	Espressif ESP32-S3 (LoRa Integrated)	€25.00	Data processing, Wi-Fi, and LoRa communication.
Air Quality Sensor	Sensirion SPS30	€45.00	Optical PM sensor for illegal dumping/smog detection.
Environment Sensor	Bosch BME680	€18.00	Gas (VOC), Temp, Humidity, and Barometric Pressure.
Soil Probe	Capacitive Soil Moisture v2.0	€5.00	Agricultural monitoring & “Human Imprint” tracking.
Power System	6V 2W Solar Panel + LiPo Battery (2500mAh)	€30.00	Ensures self-supportive operation on rooftops/farms.
Enclosure	IP65 Rated UV-Resistant Housing	€15.00	Protecting electronics from rain and UV degradation.
Connectivity	External 868MHz LoRa Antenna	€12.00	Maximizing range for the cooperative mesh network.
Misc.	Connectors, PCB, and Mounting Hardware	€10.00	Assembly and installation at Italiëlei or farms.
TOTAL ESTIMATE		€160.00	Per Full-Feature Node


Implementation Strategy for the BOM

Group Buy (Cooperative Advantage): By leveraging The Hemp Nation Group, we can reduce the per-node cost by approximately 25-30% through bulk purchasing of Sensirion and Bosch components directly from distributors.

Hemp-Based Enclosures: In line with our project at Italiëlei 26, the standard plastic IP65 housing can be replaced with a 3D-printed hemp-filament shell coated in bio-resin. This ensures even our monitoring tools minimize their Physical Imprint.

Developer Tooling: We recommend one Flipper Zero (€165.00) per cooperative sub-group (approx. every 10-20 nodes) to act as the primary field-diagnostic tool for the Policy Nexus.

Data Lifecycle & Fail-safe
The data generated by this BOM follows the Cold Bridge Architecture:

Active State: Real-time upload via LoRa to a local Raspberry Pi 5 Gateway (€85.00).

Passive State: Local SD-card logging if the gateway is down.

Validation: Automated comparison with Sentinel-2 satellite data once the packet reaches the Roadmap server.
