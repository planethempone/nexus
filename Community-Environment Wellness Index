Developing a comprehensive Wellness Index requires a multi-faceted, data-driven approach that integrates subjective (questionnaire) and objective (environmental) measures.

Here is a proposed framework based on independent, open-source, and peer-reviewed data principles, designed in a modular way for local adaptation:

🧭 The Proposed Wellness Index Framework
The index, provisionally called the Community-Environment Wellness Index (CEWI), will be a composite score derived from three main, equally-weighted sub-indices:

Where:

* S = Subjective Wellness Sub-Index (Local Questionnaires)
* E = Environmental Quality Sub-Index (Pollution & Dumps)
* N = Nature & Green Access Sub-Index (Access & Quality)



1. Subjective Wellness Sub-Index (S)

This sub-index captures the local lived experience and perception of well-being.

📝 Data Source: Local, Open-Source Questionnaires

* Methodology: Adopt a peer-reviewed, open-source well-being questionnaire model (e.g., elements from the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (WEMWBS) or similar academic-validated scales). The design should be co-created with local communities to ensure cultural relevance, as suggested by best practices for community well-being indices.
* Key Questionnaire Domains/Indicators:
* Perceived Health: Self-rated physical and mental health.
* Social Cohesion: Sense of community, belonging, and trust.
* Satisfaction with Environment: Local satisfaction with air quality, noise, and public green spaces.
* Perceived Safety: Feelings of personal safety in the neighborhood.

🧮 Calculation of S

The score S is the weighted average of the normalized scores from the questionnaire domains (e.g., on a scale of 0 to 100).



2. Environmental Quality Sub-Index (E)

This sub-index quantifies the health risk from historical and current environmental contamination.

🏭 Data Source: Independent, Open-Source Environmental Data

* Indicators & Suggested Open Data Sources:
* Air Pollution (Current): Real-time and historical data for key pollutants like PM2.5, NO₂, and O₃. Use open platforms like OpenAQ or data from organizations like NASA Earthdata which offer unrestricted, peer-reviewed satellite data.
* Historic Pollution & Dumps (Long-Term Risk): Data on registered historical industrial sites, municipal waste landfills, or known contamination plumes. In many jurisdictions, this data is public record (e.g., EPA databases, government environmental agencies). This data should be spatial and weighted by proximity to residential areas.
* Water Quality: Publicly available water testing data for local bodies of water (rivers, lakes) or tap water quality reports, focusing on contaminants of concern (e.g., heavy metals, pathogens).
* Noise Pollution: Noise maps or data from open-source sensor projects, particularly near high-traffic areas.

🧮 Calculation of E

The score E is a weighted average of normalized inverse pollution measures (where higher pollution = lower score).

* Normalization: Convert raw pollution concentration (e.g., \mu g/m^3) into a score on a 0-100 scale using a health-based standard (like WHO guidelines) as the ideal maximum score of 100.
* Proximity Weighting: For static sources (dumps, industrial sites), apply a decay function where the negative impact on the score decreases as the distance (d) from the source increases, for example, a formula related to 1/d^2.



3. Nature & Green Access Sub-Index (N)

This sub-index measures the restorative benefit derived from accessible nature.

🌳 Data Source: Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing

* Indicators & Suggested Open Data Sources:
* Proximity to Green/Blue Space: The percentage of the local population living within a 400m walk of a public green or blue space (e.g., a park, forest, or waterfront), a common peer-reviewed metric. Use open-source mapping data like OpenStreetMap combined with local government park inventories.
* Green Space Quality (Tree Canopy): Percentage of tree canopy cover within the local area, which is a key indicator for cooling and air filtration. Use satellite-derived data (e.g., from NASA or open Landsat/Sentinel imagery) to calculate a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and convert it to a canopy score.
* Usability/Activity: The density of walking/cycling trails or amenities (benches, playgrounds) within the accessible green spaces.

🧮 Calculation of N

The score N is the weighted average of the normalized scores for the three access and quality indicators (0-100 scale).

⚖️ Integration and Peer Review

* Weighting: The initial equal weighting (1/3 for S, E, and N) should be validated through local expert consultation and potentially through statistical analysis (e.g., comparing index scores to local health outcomes) to ensure the weights reflect the actual drivers of well-being in the specific community.
* Open Source: The entire methodology, including the source code for data processing, normalization, and index calculation, should be published under an open license (e.g., MIT or GPL) to enable peer review, replication, and continuous improvement by the scientific community.
* Dynamic and Iterative: The CEWI should be designed to be calculated and updated regularly (e.g., quarterly for pollution, annually for the questionnaire) to track trends and evaluate the impact of local policy.
